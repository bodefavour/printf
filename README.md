The printf project is a collaboration between Bode Favour and Thomas Aquinas Ozoagu, actual students of Software Engineering at ALX, where a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
